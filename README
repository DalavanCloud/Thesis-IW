"Direct moving transmitter geolocation based on delay and Doppler"

Abstract:
======
We analyze the problem of geolocating a single moving transmitter using an array of
stationary receivers, and propose a one-step algorithm. Although many common methods
address this problem, they all consist of suboptimal two-step algorithms: at the first
step, several signal parameters are extracted at each receiver such as Time Of Arrival
(TOA) or Angle Of Arrival (AOA), while at the next step the extracted parameters are
used to estimate the location of the transmitter. The proposed algorithm uses the same
data used in common methods. However, it is performed in a single step by maximizing
a cost function that depends on the unknown position and velocity only. This is a natural
extension of the Direct Position Determination (DPD) algorithm for the scenario
in which the transmitter is moving in an unknown velocity. In this work, we model
the problem, present the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) cost function, explore the ML cost
function for its characteristics, suggest algorithms relevant to different scenarios, present
the Cramer-Rao lower Bound (CRB) of the problem and compare numerically the performance
of the suggested algorithms to the CRLB and to the performance of the classical
two-step methods. We show that the suggested algorithm achieves better performance
than classical methods, especially in low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) scenarios
